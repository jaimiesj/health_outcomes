# Reflect on where you are now ath the completion of the boot camp, and set a goal for the next six months.
I'm proficient in Excel/VBA, Python, Pandas, SQL and Tableau and intend to intensify effort in developing myself in deep learning machine to foster growth in data analysis for the next six months.


## Selected topic
Statistics of Heavy Alcohol Consumption Amongst Student Population (between ages 15 and 22) and the Contributing Factors

## Reason why topic selected
This topic was selected because we needed a dataset that we could use to make possible predictions to an outcome using machine learning models. Meanwhile, the dataset selected is also considered simple and easy to read and majorly contains numerical values. However, this dataset was chosen because of its size and ability to generate potential results which allows our model to predict outcomes on alcohol consumption amongst student population.

## Description of data source
This dataset was culled from the UCI machine learning website which shows 2 different schools in portugal and shows students drinking consumption. This group will use different machine learning algorithms to make predictions pertaining to whether a student may be prone to alcoholism in the future.

## Questions to answer with data 
Using the sum of the Workday Alcohol Consumption (Dalc) and Weekend Alcohol Consumption (Walc), we will generate a Alcohol Consumption column, where if values fall below a certain number (to be determined), they will be deemed low risk alcohol consumers while if they fall above that number, they will be deemed high risk alcohol consumer, based on several factors, such as sex, age, parent education, parent job, number of class failures, etc
