# Heavy Alcohol Consumption in Among a Student Population Machine Learning Model

# Files
data_test1 First model ran with one provisional database using linear regression

## Selected topic
Statistics of Heavy Alcohol Consumption Among a Student Population (between ages 15 and 22) and the Contributing Factors

## Reason why topic selected
This topic was selected because we needed a dataset that we could use to make a model to predict an outcome. We wanted to stay on the topic of health
so the other datasets that were considared were all health related. However with some of the other datasets they were either to small to work with or
we were not able to use it to make a prediction with a machine learning model. So in the end this one was chosen because of its size and because it allows us to group potential results and allow our moedel to come up with were everything will fall into.

## Description of data source
Our data set which comes from the UCI machine learning website which shows 2 different schools in portugal and shows students drinking consumption. And with this dataset 
we are looking to make predictions pertaining to whether a student may be prone to alcoholism in the future.
## Questions to answer with data 
#### Using the sum of the Workday Alcohol Consumption (Dalc) and Weekend Alcohol Consumption (Walc), we will generate a Alcohol Consumption column, where if values fall below a certain number (to be determined), they will be deemed low risk alcohol consumers while if they fall above that number, they will be deemed high risk alcohol consumer, based on several factors, such as sex, age, parent education, parent job, number of class failures, etc
